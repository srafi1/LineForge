## Usage
```bash
$ make run
```
or
```bash
$ GOPATH=$(pwd)
$ go run main
```

## Features
- Simplify expressions
- Graph equations
- Graph multiple equations together (distinguished by different colors)
- Zoom in/out in the graph
- Move around the view of the graph (with translate)
- Store functions
- Trig functions and absolute value

## Inspiration
This project started off as an ambitious AP Computer Science project written in Java. I rewrote it in Go to learn the language and improve on the project.
